Injectable camera for Dishonored 2
============================

Current supported game version: v1.77.9+ (Steam)


This camera isn't really release worthy, but uploaded the source so people can use it if they want to.
It alters the camera so you can move it during Ansel, which allows you to use Ansel superresolution and
move the camera around. It also enables Ansel everywhere, not only where the game thinks it's allowed. 

No binaries.
