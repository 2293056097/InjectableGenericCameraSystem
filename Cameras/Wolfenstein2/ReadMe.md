Injectable camera for Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus Demo
============================

Works in the demo of the game, not sure if it works in the full game. If you have the full game and the tools work OK, please let me know. 

Current supported game version: v6.5.0+.  
Camera release binaries: https://github.com/FransBouma/InjectableGenericCameraSystem/releases/tag/Wolfenstein2_v100

### In-depth article about the making of these tools
I've written a long, in-depth article about how to create camera tools and how IGCS works [on my blog](https://weblogs.asp.net/fbouma/let-s-add-a-photo-mode-to-wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-pc).
